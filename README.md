# Simple Simultaneous Ensemble Genetic Programming (2SEGP)

Python code for 2SEGP, which was proposed in:

```

Differently from classic evolution which returns a single model, 2SEGP returns an ensemble.
Nice aspects of 2SEGP are that:
- it is a very simple modification of classic GP
- it has only 1 additional hyper-parameter compared to classic GP (ensemble size) and it is rather robust to different choices
- it runs almost as fast as classic GP (see Big-O's in the paper)
- despite being simpler than other existing approaches, it typically performs equal or better than them
- main ideas are portable to other evolution-based algorithms (e.g., neural architecture search)
